# GraphDB. A native graph database for Haskell

This library provides a mutable in-memory graph datastructure with complete ACID guarantees, a persistence layer, a server and a client.

## Project Status

Not released yet and currently on hold.

The project is perfectly compilable and the demos and tests execute just fine, so you can already get a feeling of what it's all about. The tutorials are coming after release.
