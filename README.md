# GraphDB. A native graph database for Haskell

This library provides a mutable in-memory graph datastructure with complete ACID guarantees, a persistence layer, a server and a client.

## Project Status

Closing in on release. It's finally happening! The project is perfectly compilable and the demos and tests execute just fine, so you can already get a feeling of what it's all about. The tutorials are coming after release.

Currently the project is undergoing extensive testing, benchmarking and API polishing.
